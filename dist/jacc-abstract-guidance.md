# JACC Journal Abstract Submission Guidelines

## Abstract Format

JACC (Journal of the American College of Cardiology) abstracts should follow a structured format that clearly communicates cardiovascular research findings.

**BACKGROUND**: "What is the clinical or scientific background that led to this study?"
**OBJECTIVES**: "What specific question or hypothesis does this study address?"
**METHODS**: "How was the study conducted? Include study design, population, and analytical methods."
**RESULTS**: "What were the key findings? Include specific data and statistical results."
**CONCLUSIONS**: "What conclusions can be drawn? What are the clinical implications?"

## Word Limits

The following word limits apply to JACC abstracts:
> Title: 150 characters maximum
> Background: 75 words maximum
> Objectives: 50 words maximum
> Methods: 150 words maximum
> Results: 200 words maximum
> Conclusions: 75 words maximum
> Total Abstract Body: 550 words maximum

## Figures and Tables

- Up to 3 figures or tables may be submitted with your abstract
- Each figure/table should have a descriptive caption (maximum 150 characters)
- Images should be high resolution and clearly demonstrate cardiovascular findings
- One representative figure will be used for abstract preview

## Statistical Requirements

JACC emphasizes rigorous statistical analysis:
- Report exact p-values and confidence intervals
- Include effect sizes and clinical significance measures
- Use appropriate statistical tests for cardiovascular data
- Report sample size calculations and power analysis
- Include measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, AUC)

## Clinical Relevance

JACC abstracts should emphasize:
- Clinical impact on cardiovascular patient care
- Potential for improving cardiovascular outcomes
- Practical applications in cardiology practice
- Health economic implications
- Guideline or practice-changing potential

## Review Criteria

Abstracts are evaluated based on:
- **Scientific Rigor**: Quality of study design and statistical analysis
- **Clinical Significance**: Impact on cardiovascular medicine and patient care
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches or significant advances in cardiology
- **Clarity**: Clear presentation of objectives, methods, results, and conclusions
- **Relevance**: Importance to the cardiovascular community

## Categories

JACC abstracts are organized into the following major categories:
- Acute Coronary Syndromes
- Arrhythmias and Clinical EP
- Cardiac Imaging
- Cardiac Surgery
- Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure
- Congenital Heart Disease
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Heart Rhythm Disorders
- Hypertension
- Interventional Cardiology
- Lipids and Atherosclerosis
- Pericardial Disease
- Preventive Cardiology
- Pulmonary Circulation
- Valvular Heart Disease
- Vascular Medicine
- Women's Cardiovascular Health

## Submission Requirements

- All abstracts must report original, unpublished cardiovascular research
- Clinical studies must have appropriate IRB approval and patient consent
- Animal studies must follow institutional cardiovascular research guidelines
- Conflicts of interest must be disclosed, especially industry relationships
- Commercial bias is strictly prohibited in scientific content
- Studies must be relevant to cardiovascular medicine and patient care

## Special Considerations

- Emphasize cardiovascular endpoints and outcomes
- Include relevant biomarkers and imaging findings
- Address clinical practice implications
- Consider health disparities and population health aspects
- Discuss cost-effectiveness when relevant
- Address safety and adverse events appropriately

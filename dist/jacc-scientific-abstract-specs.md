- Emphasize patient care implications

## Writing Guidelines

### Cardiovascular Focus
- Emphasize cardiovascular endpoints and outcomes
- Use standard cardiovascular terminology and abbreviations
- Include relevant biomarkers and imaging findings
- Address clinical practice implications
- Consider health economic aspects when relevant

### Statistical Reporting Standards
- Report hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals
- Include number needed to treat (NNT) when applicable
- Use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for time-to-event outcomes
- Report area under the curve (AUC) for diagnostic studies
- Include measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity)
- Mention power calculations and statistical software used

### Clinical Relevance Requirements
- Demonstrate clear benefit to cardiovascular patient care
- Show improvement in cardiovascular outcomes
- Address practical implementation in cardiology practice
- Consider cost-effectiveness and resource utilization
- Discuss safety profile and adverse events

## Quality Standards

### Study Design Requirements
- Use appropriate cardiovascular study design
- Ensure adequate sample size with power calculation
- Include relevant cardiovascular control groups
- Use validated cardiovascular outcome measures
- Follow cardiovascular research guidelines (AHA/ESC)

### Data Presentation Standards
- Present cardiovascular outcomes objectively
- Include measures of clinical significance
- Use appropriate statistical methods for cardiovascular data
- Report both statistical and clinical significance
- Include confidence intervals for all major findings

### Cardiovascular Clinical Context
- Demonstrate relevance to cardiovascular practice
- Show improvement over current standard of care
- Address implementation challenges in cardiology
- Consider cost and resource implications
- Discuss patient safety and adverse events

## Common Cardiovascular Endpoints

### Primary Endpoints
- Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)
- Cardiovascular Death
- Myocardial Infarction
- Stroke
- Heart Failure Hospitalization
- Revascularization
- Composite Endpoints

### Secondary Endpoints
- All-cause Mortality
- Quality of Life Measures
- Functional Status (NYHA Class)
- Exercise Capacity
- Biomarker Changes
- Imaging Parameters
- Safety Endpoints

## Review Criteria

JACC abstracts are evaluated on:

1. **Scientific Rigor** - Quality of cardiovascular research design and execution
2. **Clinical Significance** - Impact on cardiovascular medicine and patient outcomes
3. **Innovation** - Novel approaches or significant advances in cardiology
4. **Clarity** - Clear presentation and logical flow of cardiovascular research
5. **Relevance** - Importance to the cardiovascular community and clinical practice

## Special Considerations

### Cardiovascular Guidelines Alignment
- Consider alignment with current AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines
- Address gaps in current cardiovascular recommendations
- Discuss potential impact on future guideline development
- Reference relevant cardiovascular society statements

### Patient-Centered Outcomes
- Include patient-reported outcome measures when relevant
- Address quality of life and functional status
- Consider health disparities and access to care
- Discuss shared decision-making implications

### Regulatory and Safety Aspects
- Address FDA or regulatory considerations for devices/drugs
- Include comprehensive safety data
- Discuss risk-benefit profile
- Consider post-market surveillance implications

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overstating clinical implications beyond study scope
- Inadequate cardiovascular endpoint definition
- Insufficient statistical power for cardiovascular outcomes
- Lack of clinical context for cardiovascular findings
- Ignoring safety considerations in cardiovascular interventions
- Inadequate discussion of cardiovascular practice implications
- Missing relevant cardiovascular guideline context

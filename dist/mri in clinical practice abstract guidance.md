# MRI in Clinical Practice Abstract Submission Guidelines

For the 2026 Annual Meeting, we are accepting submissions highlighting “MRI in Clinical Practice.”

These abstracts should present the added value of MRI in impacting patient care.

**Clinical Practice Focus**: This category is for the presentation of work which demonstrates an improvement in patient care or diagnosis through the application of existing MR techniques. This is an opportunity to share your innovative ideas with your colleagues. The category does not require a formal study to have been undertaken.

A properly submitted abstract will have the following suggested section titles:

**Clinical Practice Focus**

- Background
- Teaching Point
- Summary or Conclusions
- References

We encourage authors to construct the abstract as a narrative of the patient’s clinical history including unique medical and social factors, as appropriate. An analysis of a series of cases is also appropriate for this category. The abstract must include specifics of the utilization, technical specifications, and contribution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  in the management of the patient’s clinical presentation.

All submitted abstracts will undergo peer review. Accepted abstracts will be presented on-site at the 2026 ISMRM Annual Meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. At least one author must attend in person to present the work.

Abstracts will be evaluated based on the added value of MRI in impacting patient care, particularly where MRI provided unique diagnostic or management insights. Examples include:

- Use of an MR artifact or novel MRI contrasts that contributed to a patient’s diagnosis 

- Use of innovative, emerging and advanced MRI techniques in diagnosis or therapy (e.g., a new sequence, contrast agent or processing method that enabled diagnosis, experience with new hardware, low-field MRI in a setting where MRI is otherwise unavailable)
- Report the added value of MRI compared to other imaging modalities (e.g., CT, ultrasound, PET)
- Detection of disease features not visible with other imaging techniques
MRI identifies complications or treatment side effects not captured by other imaging tests

## Required Abstract Structure

### Title

Suggested format: “MRI in Clinical Practice: Diagnosis of …” OR “MRI in Clinical Practice: Management of …”
Clinical Presentation and Assessment

Brief report of patient presentation, physical exam findings, and relevant laboratory tests. No identifiers may be included.
Describe imaging tests, including MRI, used to work-up the patient. Highlight aspects (e.g., magnet strength, pulse sequence and key parameters, contrast agent) of the MRI technology.
Diagnosis and Treatment

Report the final diagnosis and how the imaging diagnosis was confirmed (e.g., biopsy, follow-up imaging, combination of imaging and lab tests) and treated.
Significance

State how MRI was applied in a novel or unique way to address the clinical question and impact patient diagnosis or management. Emphasize the impact of MRI: How it changed diagnostic certainty, management, or patient outcome.  

### Key Points

List at least 3 key points about the disease and MR imaging manifestation or treatment impact relevant for clinical practice.

### Figures

Up to 5 images with figure legend. Please use arrows or labels to highlight critical features.

### References

Please appropriately cite relevant previous work including background and methodological information.

### Impact

A 40-word Impact statement should state the impact of MRI: how it changed diagnostic certainty, management, or patient outcome. The impact statement will be provided alongside the Preview figure as a teaser in the meeting program.

### Synopsis

A 100-word unstructured Synopsis should be provided to summarize the report.

### Submission Requirements

Abstracts must not exceed 750 words.
Up to 5 figures may be included.
A preview figure (for program display) must also be submitted, but will not be included in peer review.

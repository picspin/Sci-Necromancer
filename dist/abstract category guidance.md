## Choosing Your Abstract Category

### Introduction

Categories, subcategories and keywords are important ways to characterize your work so that the ISMRM can assign reviewers, so that the program committee can sort them into good sessions, and so that other members can find what they are interested in. Submission categories, subcategories and keywords evolve over time and are largely based on past submissions and feedback from both members and the AMPC members. Here we provide guidance to selecting categories, subcategories and keywords for your abstract – we recommend carefully reviewing the options with your co-authors ahead of the abstract submission deadline.

See the [full list of categories, subcategories and keywords here](/ismrm%20abstract%20categories%20&%20keywords.md).

### Category Selection

Before submitting your abstract, you will need to select a Primary Category and Subcategory as well as a Secondary Category and Subcategory. You will also select a general keyword from the list, as well as entering your own keywords if you do not see what you are looking for on the list.

Here we define Categories as the highest-level separation, such as “Acquisition & Reconstruction,” “Neuro,” “Contrast Mechanisms,” or “Musculoskeletal,” which would be numbered 100, 1100, 600, or 1000. For each Category, there are multiple Subcategories, such as “Musculoskeletal: Cartilage,” “Musculoskeletal: Bone,” or “Musculoskeletal: Muscle,” and in all cases the Category and Subcategory are selected together.

First you will choose the Primary Category and Subcategory together. For example “Acquisition & Reconstruction: Artifacts” means the Primary Category is “Acquisition & Reconstruction” while the Primary Subcategory is “Artifacts.”  

Next you will choose the Secondary Category and Subcategory together.  For example “Neuro: Tumor” means the Secondary Category is “Neuro” and the Subcategory is “Tumor.”  

Please DO NOT duplicate the Primary and Secondary Subcategories.  

Next you choose general keywords from the list, primarily to help in search, but also used as needed to select reviewers and during assembly.  

Finally, you may type in any other keywords that you feel will help characterize your abstract, especially for those searching the proceedings.

### Best Practices

Do not select the same Primary and Secondary Subcategories! This just narrows the number of sessions where your work can fit, and it is highly unlikely that you cannot find at least two appropriate Subcategories.  

It is fine for your Primary and Secondary Category to be the same, but do select different Subcategories. For example, if your abstract describes a specialized acquisition for tractography, you may select “Diffusion: Diffusion Acquisition” and “Diffusion: Tractography.”  

Many abstracts include novel methods and applications, so for example the combination of “Contrast Mechanisms: Elastography” and “Body: Liver” might be a great choice.  

In some cases the options for Categories/Subcategories may be similar or even overlap.  

If you feel that the exact Category for your work is not represented, please do your best with the available Subcategories, and use additional keywords.  

You may provide feedback on the Categories to the ISMRM – Categories evolve, and many of the changes are based on member feedback. However, this most likely would not take effect until next year’s meeting.
Duplication

The ISMRM explicitly states that multiple submitted abstracts should not cover the same work.  Please use good judgment – if there is substantial new technical development AND a substantial application or human study, then two abstracts may be justified. A general rule is, if the scope of work can reasonably be presented in a 9-minute oral presentation, then only one abstract should be submitted. Note that trying to use different Categories specifically to separate very similar abstracts is likely to be noticed by the AMPC. In cases where two abstracts from one group are very similar, ISMRM policy is to reject one or both abstracts, so please take this seriously.

### Review Assignment

For 2026, reviewer assignment will be based on the Primary and Secondary Categories and Subcategories, keywords, and other analysis of the submitted abstract. In the ideal case, a reviewer’s Category preferences may match both the Primary and Secondary Subcategories.  Alternatively, we will try to select some reviewers whose preferences include the Primary Subcategory, and other reviewers whose preferences include the Secondary Subcategory. The assignment is quite complicated, as we must work with the distribution of abstract Subcategories as well as the distribution of reviewer preferences. Be assured that the AMPC chairs will do their very best to ensure that all abstracts receive an appropriate set of reviewers.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the missing modules and functionality in the academic submission generation system (Sci-Necromancer). The system is designed to help researchers generate publication-ready abstracts and figures for various academic conferences and journals using AI-powered analysis and generation capabilities.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Sci-Necromancer academic submission generation application
- **LLM Provider**: AI service provider (Google AI, OpenAI) for text and image generation
- **File Parser**: Module responsible for extracting text content from uploaded documents
- **Export Module**: Component that generates downloadable files in various formats
- **Conference Template**: Predefined formatting and content guidelines for specific academic venues
- **Abstract Workflow**: The complete process from content analysis to final abstract generation
- **Image Workflow**: The process of image optimization or generation based on abstract content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to upload PDF and DOCX files for analysis, so that I can generate abstracts from my existing research papers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file, THE System SHALL extract the text content and display it in the input textarea
2. WHEN a user uploads a DOCX file, THE System SHALL parse the document and extract readable text content
3. IF file parsing fails, THEN THE System SHALL display a clear error message and suggest alternative input methods
4. THE System SHALL support file size limits up to 10MB for uploaded documents
5. THE System SHALL validate file types before attempting to parse them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to use OpenAI models as an alternative to Google AI, so that I can choose the best AI provider for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI is selected as the provider, THE System SHALL implement all core LLM functions using OpenAI API
2. THE System SHALL support GPT-4 and GPT-4-vision models for text and image processing
3. WHEN switching providers, THE System SHALL maintain consistent functionality across all features
4. THE System SHALL handle API key configuration for OpenAI services
5. IF OpenAI API calls fail, THEN THE System SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to export my generated abstracts in multiple formats, so that I can submit them to different venues with appropriate formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL generate PDF exports with proper academic formatting
2. THE System SHALL create DOCX exports compatible with Microsoft Word
3. THE System SHALL provide JSON exports for programmatic access to abstract data
4. WHEN exporting, THE System SHALL include all abstract components (impact, synopsis, keywords)
5. THE System SHALL allow customization of export formatting based on conference requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to work with RSNA and JACC conference templates, so that I can generate abstracts for multiple academic venues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement RSNA-specific abstract formatting and guidelines
2. THE System SHALL support JACC journal submission requirements
3. WHEN selecting a conference, THE System SHALL apply appropriate word limits and structure requirements
4. THE System SHALL provide conference-specific prompts and validation rules
5. THE System SHALL maintain separate template configurations for each supported venue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail, THE System SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. THE System SHALL implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
3. IF file processing fails, THEN THE System SHALL allow manual text input as an alternative
4. THE System SHALL log errors for debugging while protecting user privacy
5. THE System SHALL provide offline functionality for basic text editing and formatting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can trust the system's reliability and accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL include unit tests for all core functionality modules
2. THE System SHALL implement integration tests for API interactions
3. THE System SHALL provide end-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. THE System SHALL include snapshot tests for UI component consistency
5. THE System SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all modules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want improved UI/UX with better accessibility, so that the system is usable by researchers with different needs and abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
2. THE System SHALL support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
3. THE System SHALL provide high contrast mode and responsive design
4. THE System SHALL include loading states and progress indicators for long operations
5. THE System SHALL offer tooltips and help text for complex features

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want database integration for saving and managing my work, so that I can maintain a history of my abstracts and continue work across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement local storage for draft abstracts and settings
2. THE System SHALL provide optional cloud storage integration via Supabase
3. WHEN saving work, THE System SHALL preserve all abstract data and generation parameters
4. THE System SHALL allow users to load and edit previously saved abstracts
5. THE System SHALL implement data export and import functionality for backup purposes

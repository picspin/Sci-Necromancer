# Project Recovery Summary

## Problem
The project was missing critical files after a git issue, specifically:
- `package.json` - Main project configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration  
- `vite.config.ts` - Build tool configuration
- `index.html` - Entry HTML file
- `main.tsx` - React entry point
- `App.tsx` - Main application component
- Several context and component files

## Files Recovered/Created

### Core Configuration Files
1. ✅ `package.json` - Reconstructed from `package-lock.json`
2. ✅ `tsconfig.json` - Created with standard React/TypeScript config
3. ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Created with Vite + React configuration
4. ✅ `index.html` - Created with Tailwind CSS CDN
5. ✅ `main.tsx` - Created React entry point

### Application Files
6. ✅ `App.tsx` - Created main application component with conference tabs
7. ✅ `context/SettingsContext.tsx` - Created settings context provider
8. ✅ `components/Modal.tsx` - Created reusable modal component
9. ✅ `components/SvgIcon.tsx` - Created icon component
10. ✅ `components/OutputDisplay.tsx` - Created abstract display component

### LLM Provider Files (Stubs)
11. ✅ `lib/llm/index.ts` - Created LLM module index
12. ✅ `lib/llm/gemini.ts` - Created Gemini provider stub
13. ✅ `lib/llm/openai.ts` - Created OpenAI provider stub

### Type Updates
14. ✅ Updated `types.ts` with missing interfaces (Settings, SavedAbstract, DatabaseService, etc.)

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Development server is running on http://localhost:3000
- Hot module replacement (HMR) is functional
- TypeScript compilation is working
- Basic project structure is in place

### ⚠️ Incomplete/Stub Implementations
The following files exist but have stub implementations that need to be completed:

1. **`lib/llm/gemini.ts`** - Needs actual Google AI/Gemini API integration
2. **`lib/llm/openai.ts`** - Needs actual OpenAI API integration
3. **`components/JACCPanel.tsx`** - Exists but may have missing dependencies
4. **`components/RSNAPanel.tsx`** - Exists but may have missing dependencies
5. **`components/AbstractManager.tsx`** - Partially updated, may need more work

### ❌ Still Missing
Based on imports in existing files, you may still be missing:

1. **ISMRM Panel** - Referenced in App.tsx but not implemented
2. **Settings Modal** - ApiKeyNotification references it but it doesn't exist
3. **Export functionality** - ExportButtons component referenced but not found
4. **Image generation components** - Referenced in panels but not found
5. **Workflow Service** - Exists but may need completion

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Get Running)
1. Test the application in browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Check browser console for runtime errors
3. Verify which components are actually rendering

### Short Term (Core Functionality)
1. Implement actual LLM provider integrations:
   - Complete `lib/llm/gemini.ts` with Google AI SDK
   - Complete `lib/llm/openai.ts` with OpenAI SDK
2. Fix any missing component dependencies
3. Create settings modal for API key configuration
4. Test basic abstract generation workflow

### Medium Term (Full Features)
1. Implement file upload functionality (PDF/DOCX parsing)
2. Complete export functionality (PDF/DOCX/JSON)
3. Implement image generation features
4. Add ISMRM panel support
5. Complete database sync functionality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. **Module not found errors**: Check if the file exists and the import path is correct
2. **Type errors**: Run `npm run lint` to see all TypeScript errors
3. **Runtime errors**: Check browser console at http://localhost:3000
4. **Build errors**: Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

# RSNA Scientific Abstract Specifications

## Abstract Structure

RSNA scientific abstracts follow a standardized four-section format designed to clearly communicate research findings to the radiology community.

### Section Requirements

**PURPOSE (50 words maximum)**
- State the specific objective or hypothesis of your study
- Clearly define what question you are trying to answer
- Avoid broad, general statements
- Focus on the specific aim of this particular research

**METHODS AND MATERIALS (150 words maximum)**
- Describe your study design (retrospective, prospective, etc.)
- Specify patient population, inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Detail imaging protocols, equipment, and technical parameters
- Explain data collection and analysis methods
- Include statistical methods and software used
- Mention IRB approval for human studies

**RESULTS (200 words maximum)**
- Present your key findings with specific data
- Include statistical results (p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes)
- Report diagnostic performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC)
- Use tables or figures to summarize complex data
- Focus on results that directly address your stated purpose
- Avoid interpretation in this section

**CONCLUSION (100 words maximum)**
- Summarize the main findings and their significance
- Discuss clinical implications and practical applications
- Address limitations if space permits
- Suggest future research directions
- Emphasize the impact on radiology practice or patient care

## Writing Guidelines

### Style Requirements
- Use clear, concise scientific language
- Write in past tense for completed research
- Use active voice when possible
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted in radiology
- Define technical terms that may not be familiar to all readers

### Statistical Reporting
- Always report exact p-values (not just "p < 0.05")
- Include confidence intervals for key measurements
- Report effect sizes along with statistical significance
- Use appropriate statistical tests for your data type
- Mention power analysis if performed

### Clinical Focus
- Emphasize practical applications in radiology practice
- Discuss impact on patient care and outcomes
- Address cost-effectiveness or workflow implications
- Consider relevance to different practice settings
- Highlight potential for implementation

## Quality Standards

### Research Rigor
- Use appropriate study design for your research question
- Ensure adequate sample size with power calculation
- Control for confounding variables
- Use validated measurement tools when available
- Follow reporting guidelines (STARD, CONSORT, etc.)

### Data Presentation
- Present results objectively without bias
- Include measures of variability (standard deviation, confidence intervals)
- Use appropriate statistical methods for your data
- Avoid selective reporting of favorable results
- Acknowledge study limitations

### Clinical Relevance
- Demonstrate clear benefit to radiology practice
- Show improvement over current standard of care
- Consider practical implementation challenges
- Address cost and resource implications
- Discuss patient safety considerations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overstating conclusions beyond what data supports
- Mixing results and interpretation
- Using imprecise language ("improved," "better" without quantification)
- Inadequate statistical analysis or reporting
- Lack of clinical context or relevance
- Ignoring study limitations
- Commercial bias or promotional language

## Review Criteria

RSNA abstracts are evaluated on:
1. **Scientific Merit** - Quality of research design and execution
2. **Clinical Relevance** - Impact on radiology practice and patient care
3. **Innovation** - Novel approaches or significant advances
4. **Clarity** - Clear presentation and logical flow
5. **Statistical Rigor** - Appropriate analysis and interpretation

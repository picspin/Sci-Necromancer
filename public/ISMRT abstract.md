Attention:
JAK Award Applicants

If you are applying for the John A Koveleski Award for Professional Development, submissions are only accepted from MRI students and radiographers/technologists employed as MR technologists that have been practicing in MRI for 3 years or less. Qualification will be determined by a resume/CV submitted by the author, as well as a signed and dated letter on institution letterhead by the institution manager or senior staff. 

All authors are required to submit:

A resume/CV for student/employment confirmation
A signed and dated letter on institution letterhead by the institution manager or senior staff confirming your student status or equivalent.
```

### Abstract Review Process:

All abstracts will be peer reviewed. Abstracts will be blind reviewed (reviewers will be blind to the author details and institution(s) of origin).

Abstracts will be reviewed using the following criteria:

**Clinical Practice Focus category**  
- Clarity and organization of information
- Background justification and purpose
- Soundness of teaching point
- Originality and importance of the topic to the profession. 
  
**Research Focus category**
- Clarity and organization of information
- Background justification and purpose
- Soundness of methods used (study design)
- Originality and importance of the topic to the profession
- Digital Poster “Teaser” Previews. 
  
ISMRT poster award winners, for research and clinical focus, will need to provide both a digital (single slide) and a traditional version of their poster.

### Abstract Acceptance and Notification:

The seven (7) top scoring abstracts will be selected for oral presentation at the 2026 ISMRT Annual Meeting and will receive a Proffered Paper Award. Notifications of acceptance will be sent via e-mail to the submitting author the end of January 2026. Authors of the remaining abstracts will be considered and reviewed for a poster presentation. If your abstract is accepted for presentation as a traditional/digital poster you will receive detailed instructions on requirements for both the traditional and digital poster submissions.

NOTE: Authors of abstracts accepted for oral or poster or power pitch presentation MUST register and attend the meeting, either virtually or in person.

### Proffered Paper Awards:

The ISMRT is offering Annual Meeting Stipends to the 2026 Annual Meeting. Please click the link for more information. Preference is given to those who have an accepted abstract. In addition, the ISMRM Research & Education Fund is supporting all ISMRT Proffered Paper Awards with a special grant!

Proffered Paper Awards are determined by abstract submission, NOT the oral presentation.

The President’s Award: Awarded to the most outstanding abstract submitted for oral presentation in either the Clinical Practice Focus or Research Focus categories. The honoree will receive an educational stipend to support the presentation of the award-winning abstract at the 2026 ISMRT Annual Meeting.

Proffered Paper Awards: 3 additional awards are presented to the next highest scoring abstracts in each category:

Oral Presentation – Research Focus: 1st, 2nd and 3rd Place
Oral Presentation – Clinical Practice Focus: 1st, 2nd and 3rd Place
Poster Awards: Three awards are presented in each category:

Poster Presentation – Research Focus: 1st, 2nd and 3rd Place
Poster Presentation – Clinical Practice Focus: 1st, 2nd and 3rd Place
Authors of abstracts accepted for oral, or poster presentation MUST register and attend the meeting either virtually or in-person. Authors who are selected to receive an Award are required to present their abstract in-person at the meeting. Oral and poster presenters will receive detailed instructions and information pertaining to their presentation at the 2026 ISMRT Annual Meeting with their acceptance letters. Award winners are required to attend the award ceremony on Sunday.

### Step 2 of 4: Abstract Format & Layout Guidelines

The purpose of the abstract is to define the precise subject of the presentation to an audience. The abstract title should be short, informative and contain the major key words. An abstract must contain sufficient information so that if published it would be a complete report independent of presentation. The text should not contain statements alluding to results or conclusions not presented within the text.

Each abstract is accompanied by a 40-word impact statement and 100-word synopsis. These should be written in simple, clear language, at a higher level than the main abstract, to be broadly understandable to members who may not be in your direct field. The impact and synopsis must include text only, without equations or images, and be without references or citations to items described in the full abstract. We suggest the use of abstract keywords in the synopsis to improve the searchability of your abstract after publication.

We all pursue research in order to have an impact. But in the day-to-day work, and especially as we come together as a group to exchange our research results, it’s easy to lose sight of the specific end goal. The impact statement allows us to explicitly consider our end goal. We want to convey to each other what motivated our projects, what we did, and why it will matter. Not only will this enhance our conversations together, but thinking this way will also help in any networking situation, framing manuscripts and proposals, and design of future studies for impact.

Keep in mind that “impact” can take many forms; it can be, for example, that other scientists might now think about a problem differently, opening new questions or lines of investigations to be answered; it can be specific applications of the advances in technological capabilities; or new clinical information that can be disseminated and implemented more widely.

The impact of your study might affect several people, or several million people, with both scenarios being important. The question is, what will be different because of the results of your study? Who will care (other than the next post-doc in the lab), and why? Your results do not need to “change the world,” although small changes together do change the world! Beware the positive impact bias! Impact does not mean that something had a positive or expected result. “Why the work will matter” might be that it shows that a pivot or new direction is needed.

The 40-word Impact section will precede the Synopsis in the abstract and will also appear alone in the program. Therefore it should be a stand-alone statement of the potential impact of this work. The Impact section must include text only, without equations or images, and be without references or citations to items described in the full abstract.

Impact: State how the results might affect other scientists/clinicians/patients. What new questions might now be investigated? What can be done that was not possible before and why does it matter? Try to avoid vague statements and focus on specific potential impact of the results.
The Synopsis section is specific to each abstract type. For ISMRT abstracts, the Synopsis should be entered in the following sections, with a 100-word total limit applied to the 4 sections:

Motivation: State specifically what motivates the research study; for example, what new knowledge is being sought, what specific step in a clinical problem your research is addressing, and/or for what reason some technical development is needed. Try to avoid broad statements such as “early detection of x disease is important.”
Goal(s): The goal of this particular study. What specific question is being asked, what technical goal or specific advancement in capability is being sought?  

Approach: The overall approach taken to address the goal, such as the study design to test a hypothesis or type of methodology to advance imaging tools. May include animal model, clinical trial, technology development, or other.
Results: Core results of the study that show how well you achieved the goals. Note that the Impact section will appear below the synopsis when printed, so you do not need to duplicate text from the Impact section here.

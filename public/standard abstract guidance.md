# Standard Abstract Submission Guidelines

## Suggested Abstract Format

We recommend including the following sections, although we also note that there are often good reasons to deviate from this format. In each section, answer the question listed below (do not repeat the actual question in the body of your abstract).

**INTRODUCTION**: “Why was this study/research performed? What unsolved problem are you addressing?”
**METHODS**: “How did you study this problem?”
**RESULTS**: “Report the data, analyses and/or outcomes”
**DISCUSSION**: “How do you interpret the results?”
**CONCLUSION**: “What is the relevance to clinical practice or future research?”
**REFERENCES**: “List references in numerical order, citing each reference only once and using superscript Arabic numerals.”

## Figures

Up to 5 Figures should be uploaded as part of the abstract, along with a caption for each figure.
Additionally, one Preview Figure should be uploaded (as described above, with no caption).

## Word Limits. 
The following word limits will apply:
> Title: 125 characters
> Synopsis: 100 words (combined 4 sections)
> Impact: 40 words
> Body of the Abstract: 750 words (references not included)
> Preview Figure: one figure, no caption, legible at the width of a mobile smartphone
> Figures: up to 5 only for abstract
> Figure Captions: 500 characters per caption. 

## References
Cite each source in numerical order using superscript Arabic numerals.
Example 1:
> A review of regulations has been complete by the WHO.  

Example 2:
> The data were as follows 3,4:  

Example 3:
> …methods for MR fingerprinting 11-14,25,  

At the end of the abstract, list references numerically in the order in which they were cited in the text.
Example 1:  
> Rainier S, Thomas D, Tokarz D, et al. Myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 gene mutations cause paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis. Arch Neurol. 2004;61(7):1025‐1029.     

Example 2:
> World Health Organization. Injury: A Leading Cause of the Global Burden of Disease, 2000. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 2002.

### Abstract Review Criteria

Adherence to the [Global Abstract Guidelines](/call%20for%20abstracts%20global%20guidance.md) 
**Duplication of Content** (see also above). Multiple submissions of the same or nearly the same abstract is grounds for rejection of all submitted abstracts.  
**Prior Publication**. Content should differ substantially from any publication with publication date (or early view) prior to the abstract deadline.   
**Quality**: The results should be substantive and not just implied. Where appropriate:  
- Comprehensive statistical analysis should be applied.
- Images and spectra should be of the highest quality.

**Impact**: The method or data in the abstract should aim to advance or change the field in significant ways. Incremental changes are less likely to be accepted for presentation.

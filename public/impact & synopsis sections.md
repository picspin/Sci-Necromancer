# 2026 ISMRM Annual Meeting Call for Abstracts: The Impact & Synopsis Sections

## Description, Tips, & Examples for the Impact & Synopsis Section Formats

As described in the Call for Abstracts, abstracts include an Impact statement and a structured synopsis section.

Here we present an overview description, some tips, and some examples to give guidance on what is meant by these headings.

---

## Important Notes

- **The examples are just illustrative** and not meant to represent any actual particular project or abstract.
- Synopsis will always be printed with the impact section appended.
- **"Impact" will also be used as a standalone**, so it might repeat some aspects of the synopsis. In particular, it should be clear what you accomplished to enable the potential impact.
- **Since the synopsis/impact is meant for all attendees, avoid jargon.** Present complex concepts in simple terms; keep the wording (but not necessarily the thought) simple such that anyone at the meeting will be able to understand why the study was done, what was done, and what was found.
- The synopsis and impact will be included with the abstract, so the main body of the abstract need not repeat the synopsis and impact, and can concentrate on a more detailed description of all aspects of the synopsis/impact for those more specialized in the area.

## Synopsis Section (100 word total)

### Structure:
- **Motivation**
- **Goal(s)**
- **Approach**
- **Results**

### Component Descriptions:

**Motivation:** What motivated you to pursue the project? What specific need or problem did you recognize? A lack of basic understanding of a biologic process; a gap in a given diagnostic procedure; inefficiency in an imaging acquisition or analysis precluding specific clinical applications; an open clinical question within a given disease state?

**Goal(s):** Given the motivation above, what were the specific goals/targets of this study?

**Approach:** What was the approach used which would be appropriate to address the goal above?

**Results:** What are the core results of the studies which demonstrate that the goal was achieved, or if not, what did the results show.

---

## Impact Section (40 word limit)

**Impact:** Who will your results impact, and why? What new questions might now be investigated? What is understood or can be done that was not possible before and why does it matter? Keep in mind that impact can affect a few or many people, and that both positive and negative results can be impactful.

## Tips & Examples

### Tip #1: Be SPECIFIC (but not detailed)

What in particular is your study looking at within the larger problem at hand? Details regarding the study can go in the main abstract.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | X artifacts are severe in ultra-low field MRI. | X artifacts in ultra-low field MRI currently preclude evaluation of y. |
| **Impact** | X artifacts can be reduced in ultra-low field MRI, significantly improving image quality. | Ultra-low field MRI with our new (xx) gradient correction mechanism should now be able to reliably evaluate y within the needed clinical accuracy, a primary unmet need in areas where (disease) is common and ultra-low field MRI is being implemented. |

**Full Synopsis and Impact:**
> **Motivation:** X artifacts in ultra-low field MRI preclude evaluation of y. **Goal:** Our goal was to reduce the artifact such that measurement of y at zT would be as accurate as a measurement at 1.5T. **Approach:** We introduced an xx correction in the gradient waveform and tested phantoms with resolutions of (phantom spacings) at both field strengths. **Results:** Accuracy of the zT measurement was initially w, and improved to ww with the gradient corrections. **Impact:** Ultra-low field MRI with our new (xx) gradient correction mechanism should now be able to reliably evaluate y within the needed clinical accuracy, a primary need in areas where (disease) is common and ultra-low field MRI is being implemented.

### Tip #2: Impact does not mean positive results only

"Why the work will matter" might be that it shows that a pivot or new direction is needed. This might be important and impactful! Do not try to force your work to 'positive results' when that is not what the data are showing.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | A modified method (B) for imaging of (organ) was investigated. | While (organ) can be imaged utilizing Method A, improved conspicuity of x might be achieved with Method B, enabling better evaluation of the degree of (condition). |
| **Impact** | Method B conspicuity was comparable to Method A. | While Method A and B showed comparable conspicuity, Method B did not contribute additional information, suggesting that either could be used clinically depending on available sequences, and/or other avenues for diagnostics should be pursued. |

### Tip #3: For new generalized technologic capabilities

While a given advance may have the potential to impact a wide variety of applications, it is helpful to identify at least one which will clearly benefit â€“ perhaps the first application that the technology might be utilized for.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | MRI method x yields high image quality but is time consuming. | MRI method x demonstrates y but is too long an acquisition for evaluation of moving structures such as z. -OR- MRI method x demonstrates y but is too long for practical clinical implementation. |
| **Impact** | The increased acquisition speed will be useful in a variety of applications. | The improvement in acquisition speed through (method used) may benefit individuals with (disease) in need of assessment of (moving structure) which can now be imaged within (time), in addition to many other applications. -OR- The improvement in acquisition speed using (method used) makes (protocol) practical to be implemented within an overall (organ) imaging session. |

### Tip #4: Impact can take many forms

Keep in mind that "impact" can take many forms; it can be, for example, that other scientists might now think about a problem differently, opening new questions or lines of investigations to be answered; it can be specific applications of the advances in technological capabilities; or new clinical information that can be disseminated and implemented more widely.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | The metabolic process underlying liver fibrosis is not well understood. | The (particular) step in the process of fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. |
| **Impact** | A step in the process of fibrosis has been clearly delineated. | Conversion of a to b in the process of liver fibrosis has been shown to be via c; this step may be amenable to pharmacologic intervention as it is specific to the liver, and opens new biological avenues for investigation. |

### Tip #5: For clinical goals, be specific about clinical change

Denote specifically how the achieved goal will change clinical trials or care, or improve clinical processes, etc.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | Earlier detection of osteoarthritis is needed. | Physical therapy and pharmacologic protocols are being proposed to prevent arthritis from developing, however there is currently no means of evaluating their effects in vivo. |
| **Impact** | These results enable an earlier detection of (x) changes in the knee. | Our demonstration of a detectable decline in y within z months after (injury) utilizing x MRI provides a quantitative metric to be utilized within physical therapy trials for prevention of arthritis. |

### Tip #6: State patient benefits for improved diagnosis/prognosis

If improved diagnosis/prognosis is established, state in what setting particular patients might benefit, and how this might impact patient management.

| Section | Instead of | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Motivation** | There is a need for prediction of outcome in the setting of x disease. | In the setting of x disease, it is currently difficult to determine prognosis and hence counsel patients. |
| **Impact** | Our new ML algorithm improved prediction of x morbidity in the setting of y. | The improved predictive value of the new ML algorithm based on z is sufficient to allow physicians to better advise patients with (disease) of their choices of surgery vs palliative care. |
